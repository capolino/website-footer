website-footer
==============

This is a footer that I created and posted using CSS and HTML.
The icons light up on mouse over, and there are links to socialnetworks to the left side and links to a creative commons on the site and the gnu webpage and a link to the w3 HTML5 page.

There are many &nbsp;'s through out it because it inserts underscores (_) without them, and spacing is insane.
